  <h3>About</h3>
  <p>
    "feed" is a very basic RSS/ATOM feed viewer for your retro-computing
    needs. Its aim is to bring modern content to vintage machines that
    support only very basic web browsing (e.g. no SSL, JavaScript, CSS,
    modern tags...). Therefore, it's intentionally kept very simple.
  </p>
  <h3>Features</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      To support browsers with different capabilities, "feed" offers
      multiple UIs, from dead simple to.... simple.
    </li>
    <li>
      You can select how much use "feed" should make of images.
    </li>
    <li>
      Original images (JPG, PNG) are color reduced, resized and
      converted to GIF for greater compatibility.
    </li>
    <li>
      "feed" tries to give you a preview of the content the RSS links to.
      This algorithm is not perfect however, some (important) text
      elements could be missing and some redundant elements could still be
      in.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Setup</h3>
  <p>
  Ironically, you will need a Google Account and Google Sheets in a modern
  browser to bring this thing to life:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Create a new Google Sheets document (type "sheets.new" into the
      adress bar of your modern browser).
    </li>
    <li>
      Name the current sheet (in the bottom row of sheets).
    </li>
    <li>
      Create three columns with these names: <em>service</em>, <em>url</em>, <em>xpath</em>.
    </li>
    <li>
      Add your RSS/ATOM feeds! The name of the feed goes into "service",
      the URL for the feed in "url" (who would have guessed...). You
      don't need to put anything in "xpath" but if you do, "feed" will
      try to use the provided xpath to scrape the content from the articles.
    </li>
    <li>
      By adding and naming more table sheets in the bottom bar, you can
      categorize your feeds.
    </li>
    <li>
      When you're done, in Google Sheets, go to "File" / "Publish to the
      web". Publish the document and copy the link that's shown there.
      Store the link in a way your retro machine can access it.
    </li>
    <li>
      Open "feed" in your retro machine's web browser. Paste the link
      from Google Sheet in the field "Google Sheet ID / URL".
    </li>
    <li>Select your choice of UI and options, hit "Go".</li>
    <li>Happy retro surfing!</li>
  </ol>
  <h3>Tips</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      All your settings are "stored" in the URL once you've clicked the
      "Go" button. By setting a bookmark to the "Categories" page you
      can retrieve them easily.
    </li>
    <li>
      You can share your Google Sheet link with other people. By creating
      several bookmarks with different sheets you can have multiple
      collections of RSS feeds.
    </li>
    <li>
      Using Google Docs you can also have multiple people
      work on a feed collection.
    </li>
  </ul>
